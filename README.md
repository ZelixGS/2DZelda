2D Zelda-Like

My first project after I got my SteamDeck, I wanted to learn how to deploy to Linux and the SteamDeck. Turns out surprisingly simple.
Going back through it there is a lot I want to change and make better, a majority being compenentizing more things, and fixing silly issues that don't require a lot of brain power (like just instancing a new pot on pickup)

In general one thing I wanted to improve on was how great the main character's animation soft locked in a direction when going diagonal till a hard orthagonal direction was inputted. I'm also pleased with the strafing and blocking which I felt was sorely missing from the original titles back in the day.
